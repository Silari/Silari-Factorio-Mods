BIG THINGS 

Fix up orbit surfaces in SE - they should be substituted with the surface below (if not a solar orbit). -- NOT YET theres an issue in that the planet surface might not be created yet or at all.


Maybe color code or otherwise mark which ones are ready for upgrades

**********

IMAGE STUFF
Possible sprites to edit:
Add solar panel (personal or reg) to satellite to create upgrade station.
Spidertron-body-bottom is a flat disc
Cargo wagon masks are flat rectangles, could group up a couple
roboport or personal roboport equipment for the port hole.

LATER THINGS
-- Rework upgrades to make them done via the GUI, instead of just picking the first eligible one it finds.

-- on_player_changed_surface: make it redo the GUI. If the old surface isn't IN the new GUI go to the current surface, otherwise don't change

-- Add in the single surface setting. Basically this has get_sub_surface always return 'nauvis' (DONE). check_surface needs adjusted to never reject any surface (DONE). So should be done. Not tested.

-- Maybe add variance to size of created ore spots, average around 500 but allow for more/less

-- Anywhere that checks for a substitute must check that the sub isn't "", thus meaning it's disabled.
    -- We have check_surface now which checks if a surface is subbed or is blacklisted (then "" it)

-- Make make_resources check if an already existing resource shouldn't exist - ie it was edited at some point to be a liquid or larger or etc.

-- Right now I'm assuming all resources have the resource collision layer. That may not be true - should I ignore those resources, or setup some way to force using the resource layer when spawning?

-- Have the totalbaserate calculated and stored for each surface, so it doesn't need to be calculated every time gather_resources or updatetab is run.

-- Test research events work properly - seems good so far, no errors, need to add stuff to tech table for further testing.

-- Test renamesurface functionality

-- Possibly redo spawnresources to utilize Tele_Redux dynamic sizing code. Would need switch to stored list of entities instead of find.



--TODO Add a blacklist to the resources, probably in a constants file so it can be used in data and control stages.

--TODO Sprite for upgrade items and mixed miner module

--TODO Design for the targeter

--TODO Animation for ore spawning. This would work better with them spaced out a bit more, like the TODO in control to copy tele-redux code.

MAYBE THINGS
-- New interfaces - get-miner to get current miner level, get-miningrate to get current rate for given resource, get-resources to get the table of resources for the surface.
-- TODO Split this into multiple scripts to group things. One for utility, one for rocket launch, one for ore update and placement, etc. Assuming it is big enough to need that kind of organization. Might not. Utility was split already.

-- Maybe add research to up the size of spawned resource patches.

-- MAYBE put the upgrade module in with rocket silo tech, and have the upgrade tech set to enabled = false + visible_when_disabled = true, so I can use the launch event for upgrade module to set it enabled. That'd stop people from sending the 5/25 before sending the station. At least on ONE surface. wouldn't stop launching station on nauvis then launching upgrade from another surface. -- PROLLY NOT, nothing is lost anyway, just need to launch the upgrade.

--TODO Setting for require_fluid resources - three options: disallow, no random spawn, allow. No random spawn will still make them but they'll be disallowed from being randomly selected by the spawn option. Not sure if I can do that easily. Mostly done, no setting for 'no random spawn' yet.


Probably disallow any surface which lacks any resources. Would need to add the check to make_resource_table - if it generates none, sub the surface to "". May NOT want to do this since a remote interface can add a resource at any time, and I don't want them to also have to unsub the surface. Can't automatically undo "" since it could've been "" for another reason. I COULD add it to the rocket launch - regular resources already do this but I could stop upgrade launches if there aren't any resources at all - seems a waste of time though, stop hitting yourself.

SE zone info - useful to know what I can use to calculate stuff
