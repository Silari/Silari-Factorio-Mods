BIG THINGS
-- Item recipe costs
--TODO Balance item costs.
-- The idea for the upgrade items is that the rocket with the upgrade on it becomes a sort of control platform that slaves the other miners into a system of drones, scanning for resources and marking locations for them to mine with essentially mobile roboport platforms. Solar panels should be included?
-- I could include spidertrons as the 'drones'
-- Maybe include logistic chests 
-- LDS would work great for building 'platforms'
-- cost of rocket + cost of module = Cost of upgrade. 
-- Ore per level * 60 = Ore per hour. I think I want to target roughly an hour for ROI.


LATER THINGS
-- Fix spawn function to check force of targets before spawning anything. Needs to match force.

-- Test research events work properly - seems good so far, no errors, need to add stuff to tech table for further testing.

-- Test renamesurface functionality

-- Possibly redo spawnresources to utilize Tele_Redux dynamic sizing code. Would need switch to stored list of entities instead of find.

-- Add resource specific miner adjustment ratio to /asteroid info


-- Add in interfaces
    -- Add in setting for substitute which causes the surface to not be valid at all for sending things.

--TODO Make an interface to register substitutes
--If a substitute is set, and the surface to substitute has a substitute itself, use it instead.
--Also setting a sub should clear/merge the table for that surface so it doesn't need to be looped through.
--Setting a sub needs to make sure the substitute name has it's surface info setup. Note that a subname isn't NECESSARILY A SURFACE, so the create_surface event can't be assumed to have made it.
--If a substitute is set, and the surface to sub to doesn't have surface data for a force, copy it over to the new surface.

--Remote function to clear info for surface_name


--TODO Make interface to register a new resource as default.
--TODO Make interface to set resources for a surface.
--TODO Make interface to set technology to add miners - need techname, oretype, level, count?
	--TODO Make interface to set the surface to give the tech too. May need to put this in with the rest of the info


--TODO Add a blacklist to the resources, probably in a constants file so it can be used in data and control stages.

--TODO Sprite for upgrade items and mixed miner module

--TODO Design for the targeter

--TODO Animation for ore spawning. This would work better with them spaced out a bit more, like the TODO in control to copy tele-redux code.

MAYBE THINGS
-- TODO Split this into multiple scripts to group things. One for utility, one for rocket launch, one for ore update and placement, etc. Assuming it is big enough to need that kind of organization. Might not.

-- Possibly make rocketlaunch confirm resource exists for miner? Shouldn't be needed since we programmatically make modules.

-- MAYBE put the upgrade module in with rocket silo tech, and have the upgrade tech set to enabled = false + visible_when_disabled = true, so I can use the launch event for upgrade module to set it enabled. That'd stop people from sending the 5/25 before sending the station. At least on ONE surface. wouldn't stop launching station on nauvis then launching upgrade from another surface.


--TODO Setting for require_fluid resources - three options: disallow, no random spawn, allow. No random spawn will still make them but they'll be disallowed from being randomly selected by the spawn option. Not sure if I can do that easily. Mostly done, no setting for 'no random spawn' yet.
