---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.9  
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed bad check that a surface has resources available, causing it to always say the surface was invalid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.8
  Features:
    - Advanced Mode has been re-enabled. As a reminder, this allows sending of asteroid modules to space, which generate ores at a set rate (100/min with base game defaults). These generated resources are then spawned at an Asteroid Targeter, and can be mined normally.
        - Space Age has not been tested with Advanced Mode. Ores SHOULD be limited to what generates naturally on that surface, and the same restrictions of no infinite or liquid resources. Note that its likely overpowered outside of nauvis, as rate adjustments are not made for normally rarer resources like tungsten.
        - Other mods resources should similarly be available in Advanced Mode (provided they are not liquid or infinite), but no testing has been done.
    - Added miner modules for scrap. Scrap modules return more ores overall than the other resource modules, but has added complexity due to needing recyclers. Unlike other modules, this currently returns on average enough circuits, LDS, solid fuel, and ice to make a rocket with the infinite heavy oil present on Fulgora.
        - To help balance this, scrap asteroids provide only 3.5 scrap chunks on average, for a net of 4200 scrap, as opposed to 4800 for other resources.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.7  
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed recipe productivity error due to space age removing one of the technologies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.6
  Features:
    - Added setting, off by default, to allow quality mining modules to provide quality asteroids, thus leading to infinite quality ores. This is greatly overpowered compared to other methods of obtaining quality materials and thus is not the default.
      - By default, it will instead multiply the asteroid output by the quality level, double for uncommon, triple for rare, quadruple for epic, and sextuple for legendary.
    - Support for Bob's mods 2.0. It should work for most combinations of bobs mods, but note that you MUST have Bob's Electronics (bobelectronics), Bob's Mining (bobmining), Bob's Ores (bobores), and Bob's Metals (bobplates) enabled if you have Bob's Revamp (bobrevamp) enabled (bobplates and bobelectronics are the only ones to affect rocket cost significantly unless revamp is enabled).
      - Bobs with Space Age has not been tested and is not supported.
    - Minor fixes made to other mods' support to help compatability should they release but no testing has been done.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.5
  Features:
    - Added option to give recipe productivity on resource chunk crushing with each level of mining productivity. Each level of the mining productivity research gives 1% productivity to every chunk crushing recipe (and not the asteroid crushing recipes).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.4
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed recipe productivity setting not working due to using old method of allowing modules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.3
  Features:
    - Added miner modules for calcite and tungsten if Space Age is activated. These are probably not balanced. (code provided by ayyEve)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.2
  Balancing:
    - Resource amounts have been balanced for the 2.0 and Space Age changes.
      - Return is roughly 2/3 of the previous amount, to account for the cheaper rocket parts in 2.0. You still get back more resources than the rocket cost, significantly more if productivity bonuses are involved AT ALL.
        - Resource specific modules give slightly less than the raw cost of the rocket. This will still be a net positive with production modules - just 4 prod 1s in the rocket silo gives ~12.5% net gain.
      - If Space Age is enabled, you get 1/20th the amount of asteroids from each module, due to needing 1/20th the resources to make a rocket (Half as many parts at 1/10th the cost). This does mean the risk of rolling low is greater, as returns are random to a degree.
        - Note there are no resource specific modules for Spage Age resources, only the 5 basic nauvis resources (iron, copper, coal, stone, and uranium).
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that asteroid crushing recipes were only crushable in the Space Age Crushers. They're done in assemblers. This required removing Krastorio 2 crusher support - as there is no 2.0 version this shouldn't matter.
    - Fixed recipes not unlocking with rocket tech in Space Age. Space Age overwrites the unlock effects, instead of just making the changes it needs.
    - Mixed chunk recipe is now sorted with the other chunk processing recipes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Advanced mode GUI should no longer show.
    - Tentative fix for the mod not unlocking recipes when used with Space Age. Those recipes are now always unlocked if Space Age is active.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.0
  Info:
    - Release for Factorio 2.0.
      - Space Age is not explicitly supported. The mod should work fine but has not been tested, and resource amounts are not adjusted for the much cheaper rocket launches.
    - Advanced Mode is currently removed, as it's not finished. I should have it ready within a couple of weeks, if nothing comes up.
    - Support for Krastorio 2 and BZmods were removed as they do not have 2.0 versions.
      - BZmods has added support on his end in previous versions, so hopefully those will be added when he updates.
        - The scripts for these mods are still included in the files, should someone want to try and get them working on their own.
      - None of the rest of the mod support has been tested. They've been left in as they SHOULD work ok, providing there haven't been changes to the resources. Hopefully I'll get to testing these soon, but if you notice any issues please report it on the mod page.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.16
  Bugfixes:
    - Resolved error when a resource does not have a control set. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.15
  Features:
    - Added a new setting to disable asteroid and chunk processing recipes on startup. Instead they are unlocked with the rocket silo tech.
  Bugfixes:
    - Resolved an issue with the interface for adding modules that made it create basic mode recipes even when basic mode is disabled.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.14
  Bugfixes:
    - Resolved issue where launching any item on a surface that was disabled for Asteroid Mining would refund the rocket parts, instead of only activating for advanced mode items.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.13
  Bugfixes:
    - Removed another debugging print. Should be the last.
    - Calling addtype with an item name that doesn't exist will no longer cause a fatal error. Instead the mod will fail to generate any items and log the problem.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.12
  Bugfixes:
    - Removed many many many debugging print statements that were accidently left in. Sorry folks.
    - Fixed missing GUI element in the Resources tab due to not enough columns in the first table.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.11
  Features:
    - Added player's Force to the Asteroid Mining GUI by the surface selection. 
    - Updated GUI to include more information, including the total rate of a single mixed miner and the rate of an ore specific miner, as well as the current rate for each resource.
    - Both GUI tabs now use resource icons to designate the resources/orbiting miners, which looks nicer and allows upgrading that miner type by clicking the button on either tab. An icon for the mixed miner is also included with the mixed rate to upgrade that.
  Balancing:
    - Chanked stack size of asteroid chunks to 200 if Space Exploration is installed, to match the mods recommended max stack size to balance resource transport costs. 
  Bugfixes:
    - Surfaces that were substituted did not use the sub surface's orbital resources to spawn resources. In most cases, this meant they were unable to spawn anything.
        - This would be most apparent with the Single Surface setting to true, as no surface other than Nauvis could spawn any resources.
    - Ore spawning now respects the force of the targeter, instead of every force attempting to spawn ore for every targeter.
    - Space Exploration spaceship surfaces are now ignored.
  Modding:
    - Added interfaces for intramod communication. Please see the /scripts/advanced/adv-remote.lua file for documentation.
  Optimisations:
    - Some surfaces that were not viable for asteroid mining were still being processed every update. Those surfaces are now skipped.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.10
  Features:
    - Added in real support for multiple surfaces in advanced mode. Previous implementation was a place holder that used the default mining rates (based on Nauvis resources) for every surface. Mining rates are now generated for each surface based on map generation settings. Resources which generate less than 1/min will not generate for that surface.
        - The GUI now lists all surfaces in the drop down box, allowing you to view stats/assets for each surface.
        - Support for Space Exploration surfaces is included, filtering out any orbital surfaces, hidden surfaces, and the like. In a future update planet/moon orbits may share the planet/moon surface data. For now, it's disallowed as orbits can get some VERY absurd resource rates.
            - If SE is installed, surfaces will have a max rate based on the radius of the planet/moon. Right now, this is a direct multiplier based on radius / 10000 * 50. Thus a radius 5000 planet allows 25 times the base rate.
        - Will also automatically ignore Factorissimo 2 buildings and AAI Signals special surface.
    - Attempting to launch an invalid module into orbit or from an invalid surface will print a message explaining why it failed, and refund the rocket parts to make the rocket, if possible. The module itself is lost. Note that in Factorio versions prior to 1.1.69 the rocket silo will not create the new rocket until another part has been constructed. This should be fixed in 1.1.69.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.9
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed default settings using advanced mode rather than basic mode.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.8
  Features:
    - Added Advanced mode. This is still in beta, and needs balancing, graphics, and a lot of the expected mod support added. By default it is off. 
        - The previous functionality is now called Basic Mode. It is currently still enabled as the default.
    - Added brevven's tungsten resource to basic mode.
  Modding:
    - Mods can now require "__Asteroid_Mining__.scripts.addmodules.lua" to add their own items as asteroid chunks by calling amfunc.addtype(<name of item>, <tint mask to use>, <optional localized string to append to the description>). This hasn't been extensively tested, so there may still be issues. None of the items in Asteroid Mining use the description feature.
        - As an example, the following call is how Homeworld Redux adds it's sand resource as a new miner/asteroid/chunk to the mod with a slightly yellow tint to the normally brown icons:
        - amfunc.addtype("sand",{a = 0,b = 20,g = 20,b = 0})
  Bugfixes:
    - Changed a require which broke sometimes for some reason?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.7
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed Angel's Refining support so it won't overwrite that mods flotation chunks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.6
  Features:
    - Added default option to make resource chunk processing recipes use Krastorio2's Crushers for processing if present.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.5
  Features:
    - Added modules for brevven's titanium and lead mods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.4
  Info:
    - Release for Factorio 1.1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.3
  Features:
    - Added modules for Krastorio 2's raw-imersite and raw-rare-metals
      - Mixed module is not currently rebalanced, though the resource specific modules are.
  Bugfixes:
    - Added missing locale string for the crafting tab.
    - Messages aren't logged for setting resources unless they're actually set (ie the mod is present)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.2
  Features:
    - Added mixed asteroid balancing for vanilla + Simple Silicon, uses the stone->0.5 quartz recipe
      - Stone chunks are added to the mixed asteroid if Simple Silicon is installed, but the amount is not changed depending on what other mods are installed.
      - This means it's fine in vanilla, but it is not guaranteed to be enough with other mods, including Bob's.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.1
  Features:
    - Added option to allow productivity modules in all asteroid chunk recipes.
    - Added option to force recipes to not use Angel's Ore Crushers even if they are available.
    - Added setting to move (most) Asteroid Mining items to their own tab in the crafting menu.
      - Processing chunks to ores do not change their category, though some mods (Angels) change their tab.
    - Added backend improvements to allow recipes to have additional information appended to the asteroid chunk descriptions.
    - Hidden settings added: Setting 'astmine-enableminer' to false will disable all mining modules but keep chunk recipes, which could allow for alternate methods of asteroid chunk creation.
      - This is mainly for a future update that adds a different method of resource generation, but other mods could use this as well.
  Changes:
    - Lowered the minimum required versions for several mods to allow usage with Seablock Mod Pack 0.4.10
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.9.0
  Features:
    - Added support for Omnimatter's Omnite, Dark Matter Replicator's tenemut, and Simple Silicons Quartz.
    - Sulfur will now be available via asteroid mining if any mod has added 'Sulfur' as a mineable resource.
  Bugfixes:
    - Corrected missing tungsten tinting.
    - Corrected cut off sentence in 0.8.1 change log.
    - Code to autogenerate mining module icons fixed to allow for icon_size property outside of icons property.
  Changes:
    - Updated tinting for Bobmonium to be more brown, rather than black.
    - Updated tinting for Topaz ore to be a bit more orange, rather than yellow.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.8.1
  Features:
    - Updated mod's description in info.json.
    - Redid icons to make use of the original resource's icon where possible, to help better differentiate miner modules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.8.0
  Features:
    - Added very partial support for Angel's Mods. All ores (except unsorted gems) should have a miner module available for it.
        - If available, asteroid and resource chunks will be processed in the ore crushers, rather than assemblers/by hand.
    - Changed coal tinting to be slightly darker. This helps differentiate it from stone and lead chunks.
  Bugfixes:
    - Added dependencies for base and Bob's Mods to ensure proper ordering on load.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.7.0
  Features:
    - Added partial support for Bob's Mods. All ores (except unsorted gems) should have a miner module available for it. 
    - Mixed mining module should give appropriate amount of all ores to pay for a rocket, plus some profit. Sulfur and oil products are still not included. Mainly, this supports changes caused by Bobs Ores, Bobs Metals, Bobs Electronics, and Bobs modules, with default options. Due to the nature of these mods, it may not be a net gain in resources if other mods are installed, or options are changed. Damn you Bob and your wide array of useful, modular, and configurable mods!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Corrected some issues in the descriptions.
    - Mining modules now have a color mask to help identify what they are, including a box around the icon. They aren't as easily identifiable as the chunks are, but are better than the literal nothing of before.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.6.0
  Features:
    - Added resource specific mining modules. These allow you to mine for only one resource, at the cost of returning fewer total resources, though only about 8% less.
    - New items and recipes to support the above, with some tweaks to recipes to prevent them from showing up in raw resource calculations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.5.0
  Info:
    - Initial release, with basic features.
