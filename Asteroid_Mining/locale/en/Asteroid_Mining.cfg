[item-description]
asteroid-chunk=A huge piece of an asteroid containing a large amount of __1__ resources. __2__ 
resource-chunk=A large chunk of resources that can be broken down to 24 __1__.
miner-module=A rocket-mounted asteroid scanner with drill module that will send __1__ asteroid chunks back to the rocket silo.
astmin-advmodule=A comprehensive module to allow reconfiguring a rocket into an autonomous resource gathering system, complete with energy generation, ore processing/sorting/storage, and robots for repair and maintenance. This module has been designed to only harvest one specific resource.
astmin-upgrade-module=Allows you to send upgrade modules into orbit to upgrade your rockets.\n\nAn orbital space station where rockets can be modified using launched upgrade modules. This enables them to gather resources more efficiently, upgrading their level.
astmin-upgrade-5=When launched enables upgrading of 3 Level 1 rockets to a Level 5 rocket, increasing ore yields.\n\nBy reconfiguring a rocket to act as a dedicated shuttle instead of each mining rocket delivering their own cargo, with additional processing power to calculate optimal routing between all destinations, the efficiency of mining can be greatly increased.
astmin-upgrade-25=When launched enables upgrading of 3 level 5 rockets to a level 25 rocket, greatly increasing ore yields.\n\nThis module allows a rocket to be rebuilt into a large scale storage platform with command and control systems for a small fleet of mining rockets and shuttles, coordinating the entire process from prospecting to shipping and ensuring that idle time of any rocket is minimized, vastly improving yield.
astmin-mixed=A comprehensive module to allow reconfiguring a rocket into an autonomous resource gathering system, complete with energy generation, ore processing/sorting/storage, and robots for repair and maintenance.

[item-group-name]
AsteroidMining=Asteroid Modules + Chunks

[entity-name]
astmin-target=Asteroid Targeter

[entity-description]
astmin-target=Spawns a random resource within its radius from what has been gathered by the orbiting miners. Can be turned off to prevent any spawning, and/or a signal can be set of the ore type you wish to spawn here - no other type will be allowed.

[recipe-name]
asteroid-chunk=Crush __1__ asteroid chunk
resource-chunk=Crush __1__ chunk

[recipe-description]
asteroid-chunk=Crush an asteroid chunk into its component resource chunks.
resource-chunk=Process chunk into __1__.

[mod-setting-name]
astmine-crushing=[Basic Mode] Use Angel's Crushers
astmine-k2crushing=[Basic Mode] Use Krastorio2's Crushers
astmine-allowprod=[Basic Mode] Allow Asteroid Productivity
astmine-enableminer=Enable Basic Mode
astmine-makerockets=Enable Advanced Mode
astmine-newgroup=Enable Crafting Group
astmine-resamount=[Adv Mode] Seconds between updates
astmine-disallowfluid=[Adv Mode] Allow Resources Which Need Fluids To Mine
astmine-singlesurface=[Adv Mode] All Surfaces Share Resources

[mod-setting-description]
astmine-crushing=Use Angel's Ore Crushers to crush chunks if that mod is present. Applies only to Basic Mode.
astmine-k2crushing=Use Krastorio2's Crushers to crush chunks if mod is present. Applies only to Basic Mode. Angel's Crushers setting will take precedence if present and enabled.
astmine-allowprod=Allow the use of productivity modules on the asteroid chunk processing recipes. May be overpowered. Applies only to Basic Mode.
astmine-enableminer=Enables Basic Mode, which gives mining modules that when launched on a rocket return asteroid chunks containing resources. This is the method used prior to mod version 1.1.0.
astmine-makerockets=Enables Advanced Mode, which uses modules launched on a rocket which harvest resources at a steady rate forever, and can be used to spawn resource patches on a surface. Includes an upgrade system to get ores faster.
astmine-newgroup=Creates a new group icon in the crafting tab for most of Asteroid Mining's modules and recipes. Some recipes producing ores will be in the intermediate tab, or ore processing tab of certain mods.
astmine-disallowfluid=Disallow resource creation for any resource which requires fluid to mine (like uranium ore). Note that resources that PRODUCE a fluid are always not allowed.
astmine-singlesurface=All surfaces share orbiting miners and resources, including surfaces that would otherwise be disabled from mining entirely. Note: this single surface will be based on Nauvis resources.

[technology-name]
ast-min-resminer=Resource Scanning
ast-min-upgrades=Miner Upgrades

[technology-description]
ast-min-resminer=Allows creation of mining modules that target a specific resource. Provides significantly more of the targeted resource than the mixed miner module but overall resource generation is lower.
ast-min-upgrades=Provides the Orbital Upgrade Station and upgrade modules that allow upgrading mining rockets to higher levels, increasing ore yields.
